#### NLP Prediction (NLP) Business Applications

NLP is an interesting field in AI in which you build systems to try and understand language. This has an application in speech and text analysis. Communication is an essential part of business and you do not have to look far to see the application value of NLP in Finance and Business.

#### Finance

The extent of using NLP in finance has mostly been limited to sentiment analysis (similar to the study performed here). Other studies include the textual analysis of financial reports.

* Models can be used to interpret the readability of reports and see if it is associated with higher earnings management or leads to a heightened risk of bankruptcy.
* Used in conjunction with machine translation to interpret individual public discussions and to train a model looking at the predictive value of such information on the changes of future stock market movement.

#### Business

Similar to the finance applications, there are countless opportunities to use NLP within your business.

* A company can use NLP internally on email databases and chat servers to identify and flag important pockets of information, such as potential talk of confidential information and can stop a person from sending an email before it is too late.
* NLP is a crucial element of chatbots that can be used for sales, CRM, scheduling and countless other areas and tasks.

## Variable Description

The variables in this dataset is very straight forward, it includes the date, a classification variable as to whether the stock went up or down on that day and a 25 headline articles as they occurred on reddit.

Reddit does not update the articles as fast as the original sources or as fast as a news subscription service like Reuters, it is user created links and submissions most likely referring back to the original sources.

The label and the news headlines are reported concurrently. Following the EMH (Efficiency Market Hypothesis), the expectation is that the market market would react immediately to bad news expected to cause uncertainty or affect the overall market.

Due to the latency of reddit the purpose of this analysis is not so much to profit from this strategy, but rather to show that machines can learn from past words and phrases and can reasonably "interpret" articles to foretell the direction of the stock market.

This is quite interesting due to the fact that it is normally quite hard to predict the direction of the stock market, especially when you are only basing it off off the top 25 news articles of the day, which very seldom includes information directly relating to the stock market.

This piece of research is also interesting in that it shows that there is some prediction value contained in the headlines of articles. The benefit of training a machine to "read" articles to decide whether it will have an affect on the market, is that the machine does not have the biases that often affect investors.

As a reminder, the Label variable will be a 1 if the DJIA stayed the same or rose on that date or 0 if the DJIA fell on that date.

In this scenario we are going to split our data into a training set and a testing set. When splitting time-series information into the training and testing set it is best to define the training data from the beginning of the period and to use the data in the last part of the dataset as the test set. I will use 2014 as the cut-off point.

# Splitting in set
train = data[data['Date'] < '2015-01-01']
test = data[data['Date'] > '2014-12-31']
```

```python
train.shape

```
(1611, 27)

```python
# Selecting a random headline
example = train.iloc[3,10]

# Lowercasing all words
example2 = example.lower()

# This line of code tokenises and vectorises each word from a string.
example3 = CountVectorizer().build_tokenizer()(example2)

print("Before Tokenisation and Vectorisation:\n")
print(example3)

print("\nAfter:\n")
print(pd.DataFrame([[x,example3.count(x)] for x in set(example3)], columns = ['Word', 'Count']))
```

```
Before Tokenisation and Vectorisation:

['the', 'commander', 'of', 'navy', 'air', 'reconnaissance', 'squadron', 'that', 'provides', 'the', 'president', 'and', 'the', 'defense', 'secretary', 'the', 'airborne', 'ability', 'to', 'command', 'the', 'nation', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'has', 'been', 'relieved', 'of', 'duty']

After:

              Word  Count
0             duty      1
1               of      2

8              has      1
9         squadron      1
10            that      1
11             air      1

13             and      1

19            been      1
20       president      1
21              to      1
22         nuclear      1
23         ability      1
```

Therefore, the above code transforms the list into a table of counts. The above steps just gives you an idea of the process at hand that happens behind the scenes in scikit-learn (library).

The first step is easy and that is to connect all the strings associated with the target variable into one.

```python
trainheadlines = []
for row in range(0,len(train.index)):
    trainheadlines.append(' '.join(str(x) for x in train.iloc[row,2:27]))
# Recall that append starts a new index for each operations
```

```python
trainheadlines[:100]
```

With our headlines formatted, we can set up our CountVectorizer. To start, let's just use the default settings and see how it goes! Below, we'll name our default vectorizer, then use it on our list of combined headlines. After that, we'll take a look at the size of the result to see how many words we have.

```python
basicvectorizer = CountVectorizer()
basictrain = basicvectorizer.fit_transform(trainheadlines)
print(basictrain.shape)
```

```
(1611, 31675)
```

Our resulting table contains counts for 31,675 different words! The shape of the sparse matrix (Sparse matrix is a matrix which contains very few non-zero elements.) also shows that their is 1611 observations (days) where we expect to train on the target variable. The left hand shows the number of occurence for each word. Each word is not described as a number.

Now, let's train a logistic regression model using this data. In the cell below, we're simply naming our model, then fitting the model based on our X and Y values.

```python
print(basictrain)

```

```python
# So you can easily incorporate a sparse matrix to train the model.
basicmodel = LogisticRegression()
basicmodel = basicmodel.fit(basictrain, train["Label"])
```

Our model is ready to go, so let's set up our test data. Here, we're just going to repeat the steps we used to prep our training data, then predict whether the DJIA increased or decreased for each day in the test dataset.

```python
testheadlines = []
for row in range(0,len(test.index)):
    testheadlines.append(' '.join(str(x) for x in test.iloc[row,2:27]))
basictest = basicvectorizer.transform(testheadlines)
predictions = basicmodel.predict(basictest)

#### The predictions are set, so let's use a crosstab to take a look at the results!
#### The cross-tab is pretty interesting I have never really ised it.

pd.crosstab(test["Label"], predictions, rownames=["Actual"], colnames=["Predicted"])
```

<div style="overflow: auto;"><table class="dataframe" border="1"><thead><tr style="text-align: right;"><th>Predicted</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr><tr><th>Actual</th><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>0</th><td>61</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>92</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

The prediction accuracy at first glance is not very high. From the terms that has been used to predict, it would be interesting to identify which words contribute most to a rise or fall in the market by identifying the top coefficients and associated words.

```python
# A way to obtain the feature names from the associated numbers in the matrix.
basicwords = basicvectorizer.get_feature_names()
basiccoeffs = basicmodel.coef_.tolist()[0]
coeffdf = pd.DataFrame({'Word' : basicwords,
                        'Coefficient' : basiccoeffs})
coeffdf = coeffdf.sort_values(['Coefficient', 'Word'], ascending=[0, 1])
coeffdf.head(10)
```

# Advanced Modeling

The technique we just used is known as a bag-of-words model. We essentially placed all of our headlines into a "bag" and counted the words as we pulled them out. However, most people would agree that a single word doesn't always have enough meaning by itself. Obviously, we need to consider the rest of the words in the sentence as well! This is where the n-gram model comes in. In this model, n represents the length of a sequence of words to be counted. This means our bag-of-words model was the same as an n-gram model where n = 1. So now, let's see what happens when we run an n-gram model where n = 2. Below, we'll create a new CountVectorizer with the n-gram parameter set to 2 instead of the default value of 1.

```python
advancedvectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2,2))
advancedtrain = advancedvectorizer.fit_transform(trainheadlines)
```

```python
print(advancedtrain.shape)
```

```
(1611, 366721)
```

This time we have 366,721 unique variables representing two-word combinations. This is noteably higher than the previous time, the reason for this is the logic that hides behind factorial computations.

```python
advancedmodel = LogisticRegression()
advancedmodel = advancedmodel.fit(advancedtrain, train["Label"])
```

```python
testheadlines = []
for row in range(0,len(test.index)):
    testheadlines.append(' '.join(str(x) for x in test.iloc[row,2:27]))
advancedtest = advancedvectorizer.transform(testheadlines)
advpredictions = advancedmodel.predict(advancedtest)
```

```python
pd.crosstab(test["Label"], advpredictions, rownames=["Actual"], colnames=["Predicted"])
```

<div style="overflow: auto;"><table class="dataframe" border="1"><thead><tr style="text-align: right;"><th>Predicted</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr><tr><th>Actual</th><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>0</th><td>66</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><th>1</th><td>45</td><td>147</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

This time we're up to nearly 57% prediction accuracy. That means we can finally beat a newspaper reading monkey. Keep in mind that with this analysis we have barely scratched the surface of NLP here, moreover we have barely scratched the surface in terms of machine learning techniques. In the future it might be interesting using various adjustments of n-grams (3,4,5 - word phrases) and seeing whether it will result in different outcomes.

* ngram\_range=(1,1) Bag of words (default)
* ngram\_range=(2,2) Bigrams only
* ngram\_range=(1,2) Both!

Now it would be interesting to see if the highest and lowest coefficient words "phrases" make more intuitive sense.

```python
advwords = advancedvectorizer.get_feature_names()
advcoeffs = advancedmodel.coef_.tolist()[0]
advcoeffdf = pd.DataFrame({'Words' : advwords,
                        'Coefficient' : advcoeffs})
advcoeffdf = advcoeffdf.sort_values(['Coefficient', 'Words'], ascending=[0, 1])
advcoeffdf.head(10)
```

<div style="overflow: auto;"><table class="dataframe" border="1"><thead><tr style="text-align: right;"><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Coefficient</th><th>Words</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>272047</th><td>0.286533</td><td>right to</td></tr><tr><th>24710</th><td>0.275274</td><td>and other</td></tr><tr><th>285392</th><td>0.274698</td><td>set to</td></tr><tr><th>316194</th><td>0.262873</td><td>the first</td></tr><tr><th>157511</th><td>0.227943</td><td>in china</td></tr><tr><th>159522</th><td>0.224184</td><td>in south</td></tr><tr><th>125870</th><td>0.219130</td><td>found in</td></tr><tr><th>124411</th><td>0.216726</td><td>forced to</td></tr><tr><th>173246</th><td>0.211137</td><td>it has</td></tr><tr><th>322590</th><td>0.209239</td><td>this is</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
